/**
 * @file dirent.h
 * @brief A POSIX-like dirent API implementation for Windows using the Windows API.
 *
 * This header provides a subset of the POSIX dirent API for Windows, allowing C and C++
 * code to use familiar functions like opendir(), readdir(), closedir(), etc. to
 * iterate through directory entries.
 *
 * @warning **Limitations:**
 *   - **`telldir()` and `seekdir()` are minimally implemented.** `seekdir()` only supports
 *     seeking to the beginning (loc = 0), the end (loc = -1), or forward to a specific entry
 *     by its index (loc > 0). Seeking to arbitrary positions is implemented by iterating
 *     through the entries, making it an **O(N)** operation in the worst case, where N is
 *     the desired position. `telldir()` returns the index of the last entry read by `readdir()`.
 *   - **`d_ino` is implemented using Windows file index.** It does not represent a
 *     true POSIX inode number but can be used to identify files uniquely.
 *   - **`d_reclen` is not supported.** The field is not present in this implementation.
 *   - **Thread safety:** This implementation is not inherently thread-safe. Using the
 *     same `DIR` pointer from multiple threads simultaneously can lead to undefined
 *     behavior.
 *
 * @note **Windows-Specific Behavior:**
 *   - Filenames are stored in `d_name` as **UTF-8** encoded strings.
 *   - Extended-length paths (longer than `MAX_PATH`) are supported using the `\\?\` prefix.
 *   - The implementation uses the Windows API (`FindFirstFileW`, `FindNextFileW`, etc.)
 *     internally.
 *   - The `DIR` type is an opaque pointer to an internal structure.
 */
